          no person to face especially in 2020 when people should know better by now.
          After 100's of years of slavery, we must not forget those who have come before

        <p>Save our Future, she said as she held a sign next to another sign with a
          drawing of our world on it. She was not fooled by the Government's ploy to get everyone sick and create chaos
          as
          a distraction for election year so one could campaign. No one could physically meet anywhere. That was up
          until now.
          The protests have seiged the streets with thousands of humans marching for their rights, marching for justice,
          for peace, and
          for hope. Our children must not see this world we have created. We call for change. Sign our petition today if
          you stand for justice. BLM. Save the world.</p>
