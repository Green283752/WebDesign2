                    Breonna Taylor was murdered by a police officer. George Floyd was murdered by a police officer. 
                    These are horrible tragedies no one should face especially in 2020 when people should know 
                    better. After hundreds of years of slavery, we must not forget those who have come before
                    us and died so we could be here today and march in your streets all over the world
                    in honor of this human life and death. Defund the police. BLack Lives Matter! 
                    These protests are changing laws. We urge you to stand up for what is right. Petitions 
                    or protests in the streets. All we know is this cannot continue.

                    many important
                    events we cannot forget that this is a Presidential Election year! Democracy must prevail! The
                    marches are for justice at all fronts. People must vote for our voices to be heard. We must not
                    remain silent. If this murder has taught us anything at all, it is to stand up for what we believe
                    in.
                    This government is not our friend. It does not support our needs as human beings on this Earth. And
                    this
                    government must be overruled by democracy. If it cannot support us, we must fight for our beliefs
                    any
                    way we know how. Of course peaceful tactics are best. Get the word out and vote democratic you, your
                    family and community won't be sorry. There is much to do to prepare for this giant election that the
                    entire world will be watching. If you aren't from a state where mail-in votes are an option we urge
                    you to
                    help us change these laws to permit mail-in voting. We must do everything in our power to win this
                    election
                    as democrats. We need to make sure that people have the option to vote in all states and not be
                    counted out because of
                    financial difficulties or health issues. Everyone must have the opporty to be heard. Sign petitions,
                    do whatever
                    you need to do to let everyone know that they deserve the option to vote by mail.

                    We believe that by taking written action we can make great changes to this country. Our Country's
                    name has been
                    tarnished worldwide. It's enough already. This President has made his point and unleashed all of the
                    racist and homophobic people of this country. We want to make sure they know they are not welcome
                    here
                    any longer. People are dying every day because of these insane hate crimes and inernal racism that
                    have
                    been here since the beginning of our country. Slavery should be a thing of the past not an everyday
                    crisis
                    of the present. We can no longer ignore our racist Police officers, citizens, and political figures.
                    We
                    are all a part of this mess and we must all work together to get us out. There shouldn't be one man
                    against another or one man against the government and all of it's employees. How have we gotten so
                    off track
                    that these hate crimes are seen as okay by government officials? We must take action. Please join us
                    in
                    signing our many petitions to stand up for the justice and equality that we know is honorable. Take
