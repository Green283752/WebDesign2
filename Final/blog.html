                    A man was murdered by a police officer. This is a horrible tragedy for
                    no person to face especially in 2020 when people should know better by now.
                    After 100's of years of slavery, we must not forget those who have come before
                    us and died so we could be here today and march in your streets all over the world

                    physically meet anywhere. That was up until now. The protests have seiged the streets

                    Don't forget about the elections people! Even though we are isolated and distracted right now by her important
                    events we cannot forget that this is a Presidential Election year! Democracy must prevail! The 
                    marches are for justice at all fronts. People must vote for our voices to be heard. We must not
                    remain silent. If this murder has taught us anything at all it is to stand up for what we believe in.
                    This government is not our friend. It does not support our needs as human beings on this Earth. And this 
                    government must be overruled by democracy. If it cannot support us, we must fight for our beliefs any

                    Our petitions have made a difference in people's lives and deaths. We are partnering with the ACLU to
                    voice our concerns over unresolved issues in the political field as well as at the human level.
                    We believe that by taking written action we can make great changes to this country. Our Country's name has been 
                    tarnished worldwide. It's enough already. This President has made his point and unleashed all of the 
                    racist and homophobic people of this country. We want to make sure they know they are not welcome here
                    any longer. People are dying every day because of these insane hate crimes and inernal racism that have
                    been here since the beginning of our country. Slavery should be a thing of the past not an everyday crisis
                    of the present. We can no longer ignore our racist Police officers, citizens, and political figures. We 
                    are all a part of this mess and we must all work together to get us out. There shouldn't be one man 
                    against another or one man against the government and all of it's employees. How have we gotten so off track 
                    that these hate crimes are seen as okay by government officials? We must take action. Please join us in 
                    signing our many petitions to stand up for the justice and equality that we know is honorable. Take one 
                    minute of your time to help another human in thiers.</p>
