          MoveOn is where millions mobilize for a better society—one where everyone can thrive.

          Whether it’s supporting a candidate, passing legislation, or changing our culture, MoveOn members are
          committed to an inclusive and progressive future. We envision a world marked by equality, sustainability,
          justice, and love. And we mobilize together to achieve it.

          MoveOn members are a force for social justice and political progress. We come from all 50 states and all walks
          of life. Together, we are at once large and nimble, targeting our resources purposefully, yet pivoting quickly
          as we identify new opportunities for change and mobilize to seize them. Our rapid-response organizing and
          campaigning, communications interventions, digital innovation, rigorous data science and testing, and culture
          of grassroots participation have repeatedly combined to produce real-world impact, changing outcomes and
          making our country better.

          MoveOn is more than our name. It is our challenge to America: to move forward boldly and fearlessly, upholding
          and enacting the values that will make our country work for all of us.

          We are the many, and we are powerful. Every day, together, we fight to win. It’s what we’ve always done. It’s
          what we’re built to do.
