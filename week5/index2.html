                <p>Another notable figure to emerge during this period is Bill 
                    "Bojangles" Robinson, who was a protégé of Alice Whitman of 
                    the Whitman Sisters around 1904 (then 'Willie Robinson'). 
                    Well-versed in both Buck and Wing dancing and Irish step dancing, 
                    Bill Robinson joined the vaudeville circuit in 1902, in a duo 
                    with George W. Cooper. The act quickly became famous, headlining 
                    events across the country, and touring England as well. In 1908, 
                    however, the two had an altercation and the partnership was ended. 
                    Gambling on his popularity, Robinson decided to form a solo act, 
                    which was extremely rare for a black man at that time. Despite this, 
                    he had tremendous success and soon became a world-famous celebrity.
                    He went on to have a leading role in many films, notably in movies 
                    starring Shirley Temple.

                    <h1>Tap Dance History</h1>
                <p>
                    Tap dance has its roots in the fusion of several ethnic 
                    percussive dances, including from various African countries, 
                    including a particular dance called Gioube Juba Dance, English 
                    clog dancing and Irish jigs; the relative contribution of different 
                    traditions is a point of disagreement among historians and dance 
                    scholars. Tap dance is believed by some to have begun in the mid-1800s 
                    during the rise of minstrel shows. Famous as Master Juba, William Henry 
                    Lane became one of the few black performers to join an otherwise white 
                    minstrel troupe, and is widely considered to be one of the most famous 
                    forebears of tap dance.

                <p>
                    As the minstrel shows began to decline in popularity, tap dance became 
                    increasingly popular Vaudeville stage. Due to the two-colored rule, which 
                    forbade black people from performing solo, the majority of Vaudeville tap 
                    acts were duets. This gave rise to the famous pair "Buck and Bubbles", 
                    which consisted of John William <strong><em>"Bubbles"</em></strong> Sublett tap 
                    dancing and Ford "Buck" Washington on piano. The duo perfected the "class act", 
                    a routine in which the performers wore impeccable tuxedos, which has since 
                    become a common theme in tap dance. The move is seen by some as a rebuttal 
                    to the older minstrel show idea of the tap dancer as a "grinning-and-dancing 
                    clown." John <strong><em>"Bubbles"</em></strong> Sublett is also known amongst 
                    hoofers as the "Father of Rhythm Tap" which incorporates more percussive heel 
                    drops and lower-body movements.
