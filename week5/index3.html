                        <h1>Tap Dance Steps</h1>
                        <p>
                            Tap dancers make frequent use of syncopation. Choreography typically starts 
                            on the eighth or first beatcount. Another aspect of tap dancing is improvisation. 
                            Tap dancing can either be done with music following the beats provided, or without 
                            musical accompaniment; the latter is known as "a cappella tap dancing". Hoofers are 
                            tap dancers who dance primarily <strong><em>"closer to the floor",</em></strong> 
                            using mostly footwork and not showing very much arm or body movement. Steve Condos 
                            developed an innovative rhythmic tap style that influenced the work of later tap 
                            dancers such as Gregory Hines and Savion Glover. Condos passed his knowledge on 
                            to his protege Marshall L. Davis Jr. The majority of early hoofers, such as Sammy 
                            Davis Jr., Glover, Hines, and LaVaughn Robinson were African American men. Savion 
                            Glover helped bring tap dance into mainstream media by choreographing Happy Feet, 
                            a film about a tap dancing penguin. Another well-known tap film is 1989's Tap, 
                            starring Gregory Hines and many old-time hoofers.

                        <p>
                            Many steps also have single, double, and triple versions, including pullbacks, 
                            timesteps, and drawbacks. In tap, various types of turns can be done, including 
                            step heel turns, Maxi Ford turns, cramproll turns, and drag turns. Timesteps are 
                            widely used in tap and can vary in different areas. These consist of a rhythm 
                            that is changed to make new timesteps by adding or removing steps. Tap dancing 
                            can also be done using an a cappella method, in which no musical accompaniment 
                            is provided and dancers creating their own "music" through the sounds of their 
                            taps. In group tap dances, the steps are typically kept simple and easy to control. 
                            The group of dancers must work together to create the sound, keeping their steps at 
                            the correct speed to match each other.
