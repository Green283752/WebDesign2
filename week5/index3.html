                            Many steps also have single, double, and triple versions, including pullbacks, 
                            timesteps, and drawbacks. In tap, various types of turns can be done, including 
                            step heel turns, Maxi Ford turns, cramproll turns, and drag turns. Timesteps are 
                            widely used in tap and can vary in different areas. These consist of a rhythm 
                            that is changed to make new timesteps by adding or removing steps. Tap dancing 
                            can also be done using an a cappella method, in which no musical accompaniment 
                            is provided and dancers creating their own "music" through the sounds of their 
                            taps. In group tap dances, the steps are typically kept simple and easy to control. 
                            The group of dancers must work together to create the sound, keeping their steps at 
                            the correct speed to match each other.

                        <p>
                            Tap dancers make frequent use of syncopation. Choreography typically starts 
                            on the eighth or first beatcount. Another aspect of tap dancing is improvisation. 
                            Tap dancing can either be done with music following the beats provided, or without 
                            musical accompaniment; the latter is known as "a cappella tap dancing". Hoofers are 
                            tap dancers who dance primarily <strong><em>"closer to the floor",</em></strong> 
                            using mostly footwork and not showing very much arm or body movement. Steve Condos 
                            developed an innovative rhythmic tap style that influenced the work of later tap 
                            dancers such as Gregory Hines and Savion Glover. Condos passed his knowledge on 
                            to his protege Marshall L. Davis Jr. The majority of early hoofers, such as Sammy 
                            Davis Jr., Glover, Hines, and LaVaughn Robinson were African American men. Savion 
                            Glover helped bring tap dance into mainstream media by choreographing Happy Feet, 
                            a film about a tap dancing penguin. Another well-known tap film is 1989's Tap, 
                            starring Gregory Hines and many old-time hoofers.

                            Early tappers like Fred Astaire provided a more ballroom look to tap dancing, 
                            while Gene Kelly introduced ballet elements and style into tap. This style of 
                            tap led to what is today known as Broadway style, which is popular in American 
                            culture. It often involves high heeled tap shoes and show music, and is usually 
                            the type of tap first taught to beginners. Examples of this style are found in 
                            Broadway musicals such as Anything Goes and 42nd Street. Common tap steps include 
                            the shuffle, shuffle ball change, double shuffle, leap shuffle, hop shuffle, flap, 
                            flap ball change, running flaps, flap heel, cramproll, buffalo, Maxi Ford, Maxi 
                            Ford with a pullback, pullbacks, wings, Cincinnati, the shim sham shimmy (also 
                            called the Lindy), Irish, waltz clog, the paddle roll, the paradiddle, stomp, 
                            brushes, scuffs, spanks, riffs, and single and double toe punches, hot steps, 
                            heel clicks, time steps, over-the-tops, military time step, New Yorkers, Shiggy 
                            Bops, drawbacks, and chugs. In advanced tap dancing, basic steps are often combined 
                            together to create new steps.
