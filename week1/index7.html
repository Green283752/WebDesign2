                Her work was all over my school supplies as a child. I like her 
                color schemes although some of it is very cluttered. Looking 
                back now, I seem to be critiquing all of the art I see because 
                that's what I do now. This is the new me. I'm a walking critic.
                Lisa, may your work live on through to the present day even if I 
                think it's too cluttered and needs more white space.</p>

            <p style= "padding-left: 20px;padding-right:20px;"> Lisa's color palette's are definitely 
                what attracted me to her art. I like colorful art and designs. 
                However, I'm working on making my art balanced with color. To have 
                a distinctly bright palette is sometimes shocking to the naked eye.
                Therefore, I feel that it must be in balance with the white space, 
                composition, focus, and layout of the page. </p>
