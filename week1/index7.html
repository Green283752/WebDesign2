            <p style= "padding-left: 20px;padding-right:20px; padding-bottom: 2px;">Lisa Frank is one of the most iconic 1990's commercial artists. 
                Her work was all over my school supplies as a child. I like her 
                color schemes although some of it is very cluttered. Looking 
                back now, I seem to be critiquing all of the art I see because 
                that's what I do now. This is the new me. I'm a walking critic.
                Lisa, may your work live on to the present day even if it's too cluttered 
                and needs more white space. Although, her color palette's are definitely what 
                attracted me to her art. I like colorful art and designs. However, I'm currently 
                working on making my own art with more balanced color. To have a distinctly 
                bright palette is sometimes </p>

                shocking to the naked eye. Therefore, I feel that it must be in balance with the white space, 
                composition, focus, and layout of the page. Although, sometimes I'm in 
                a Lisa Frank kind of a mood where I like to see a brightly colored 
                unicorn on my binder from 50 miles away. There is something about bright 
                colors that you just can't run away from. They are loud, intense, and 
                attention-grabbing. Not only do these nostalgic color palettes remind me 
                of my childhood, but they exude this feeling of comfort. Usually she uses rainbow 
                colors all in one piece. I like to do that in my own art as well. I'm currently 
                trying to make it so my pieces have the right amount of white space. 
                I have been known to pull a Lisa and try to fill the entire page with content and 
                now I can see why that doesn't always work design-wise.</p>
