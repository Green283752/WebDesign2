            <p style= "padding-left: 20px;padding-right:20px"> Lisa Deborah Frank (born April 21, 1955) is an American businesswoman, the founder of Lisa Frank Incorporated, 
                headquartered in Tucson, Arizona. She is known for producing whimsical commercial design for school supplies 
                and other products that are primarily marketed to children.
                Frank is the founder and CEO of Lisa Frank Incorporated. Frank founded the company in 1979 at the age of 24, 
                and continues to lead it as of 2019. Her corporation's artwork features rainbow and neon colors and stylized 
                depictions of animals, including dolphins, pandas, and unicorns. In the 1980s and 1990s, her products – 
                including school supplies such as lunchboxes and Trapper Keepers, as well as toys and stickers – were popular among 
                elementary and middle school-aged girls. The company's headquarters is in Tucson, Arizona.

            <p style= "padding-left: 20px;padding-right:20px"> In 2011, she launched a colorful line of clothing.
                Frank partnered with Reebok to release two versions of limited-release Reebok Classic Leathers shoes in 2017.
                In 2017, Entertainment Weekly reported that the designer was partnering with producer Jon Shestack to develop 
                a movie inspired by her work.
                In 2019, Frank designed the logo for John Mayer's Instagram television series, Current Mood.
                Frank is "notoriously elusive and private." In a 2012 interview with Urban Outfitters, they agreed to obscure her face.
                She is an alumna of the Kingswood School (today: Cranbrook Kingswood School), a preparatory school in Bloomfield Hills, 
                Michigan. Her father was an art collector and introduced her to the work of Pop Art artists like Peter Max.
                In 2005 Lisa Frank divorced James Green, the CEO and co-share holder of Lisa Frank Incorporated. The court agreed to 
                assign control of the company to Lisa Frank.</p>
